Advantages over Traditional Bitcoin (BTC)
CPU vs. ASIC Mining
BTCturquoiseâ€™s GhostRider algorithm promotes CPU-based mining, in stark contrast to Bitcoin's ASIC-centric mining landscape. This approach democratizes mining participation, allowing individuals to contribute to network security without investing in specialized, often costly hardware. The result? A more decentralized, resilient, and community-driven network.

Accessibility and Inclusivity

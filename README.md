This innovative approach encourages CPU mining, enabling broader participation without the need for specialized hardware. It fosters a more inclusive mining environment, promoting fairness and accessibility.

Security, Speed, and Sustainability
With a focus on robust security measures and faster transaction confirmations, BTCturquoise facilitates seamless, near-instant payments globally. Its sustainable supply control and demand-driven approach align with market dynamics, fostering a balanced and reliable ecosystem.

Open Source and Collaborative Development
BTCturquoise operates under the MIT license, encouraging transparency and collaboration within its development community. Active development occurs in separate branches, with stable releases tagged for clarity in the Tags section.

Advantages over Traditional Bitcoin (BTC)
CPU vs. ASIC Mining
BTCturquoiseâ€™s GhostRider algorithm promotes CPU-based mining, in stark contrast to Bitcoin's ASIC-centric mining landscape. This approach democratizes mining participation, allowing individuals to contribute to network security without investing in specialized, often costly hardware. The result? A more decentralized, resilient, and community-driven network.

Accessibility and Inclusivity
By prioritizing CPU mining, BTCturquoise aims to level the playing field, welcoming a broader spectrum of participants into the world of cryptocurrency mining. This inclusivity aligns with the original ethos of decentralized currencies, empowering individuals globally to engage in the network's operations.

Sustainability and Innovation
BTCturquoise's emphasis on CPU mining not only enhances network decentralization but also promotes a more sustainable approach to cryptocurrency mining. The reduced energy consumption associated with CPU mining fosters a greener and more environmentally friendly mining process.

"This currency operates as a decentralized and open source system, meaning that there is no central entity responsible for its operation, development or management. As such, users participate in this network with full knowledge that there are no explicit guarantees or responsibilities by a centralized entity. The use of this currency and its associated software involves inherent risks, including the possibility of loss of coins or digital assets. Users take full responsibility for their actions when interacting with the network and accept that there are no guarantees of performance, stability or security. Users are urged to exercise due diligence, understand the risks involved and make informed decisions. Decentralization and the absence of a central authority mean that each individual is responsible for protecting their private keys, securing their digital assets, and carefully evaluating any participation in the network."

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
